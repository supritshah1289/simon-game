The tiles in the game flashes really fast right after you done clicking on level 1. So if you blink or not you will have chances to lose. 

#challenges
1. Controlling flashing tile function after user is done clicking first pattern.
2. Spend time debugging to compare numbers in my logic however, their typeof was string and number. Mike helped me figure it out. 

#unsolved
1. Controlling flashing. (used setTimeout but it's not working out for me)
